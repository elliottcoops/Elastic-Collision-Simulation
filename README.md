# Elastic-Collision-Simulation

This is a complex physics simulation leveraging the use of elastic collisions, and the laws of conservation of momentum and kinetic energy under such collsions.

## What is an elastic collision

An elastic collision is where both momentum and kinetic energy are both conserved. This is such that, the total kinetic energy and momentum in the system of masses before, is exactly equal to that after. 

In any situation for momentum: P (Momentum) = M (Mass) * V (Velocity)
Thus for an elastic collision between two objects: 

  - P_before_collsion = (m1 * v1_inital) + (m2 * v2_initial)
  - P_after_collision = (m1 * v1_after) + (m2 * v2_after)

Setting these equal to one another due to an elastic collision:

  - (m1 * v1_inital) + (m2 * v2_initial) = (m1 * v1_after) + (m2 * v2_after)
